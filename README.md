## Overview

This project implements an AI Document Assistant leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide intelligent and accurate responses based on information extracted from documents. It aims to streamline document analysis, information retrieval, and question-answering processes for various applications.

## Features

*   **Multi-Source Information Retrieval:** Efficiently extracts and synthesizes information from diverse sources, including PDFs and text files, using advanced algorithms.
*   **Semantic Data Processing:** Converts text content into semantic vectors for precise information retrieval.
*   **Dynamic Response Generation:** Utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate detailed, contextually relevant responses.
*   **Intuitive Summarization:** Offers a PDF summarization tool that condenses lengthy documents into concise summaries.
*   **Question Answering:** Allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive accurate answers grounded in the provided documents.
*   **Reduced Hallucinations:** By grounding responses in your specific business knowledge, it significantly reduces the risks of inaccurate LLM output or hallucinations.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** Main programming language used for the project.
*   **LangChain:** Framework for building LLM-powered applications.
*   **Vector Database (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, Pinecone):** Stores vector embeddings for efficient similarity searches.
*   **Sentence Embedding Model (e.g., OpenAI Embeddings):** Converts text into vector representations.
*   **Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI GPT models):** Generates human-quality text responses.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Adya-Prasad/AI-Document-Assistant-with-RAG.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd AI-Document-Assistant-with-RAG
    ```
3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    conda create -p venv python==3.9 -y 
    conda activate venv
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Configure API keys (if applicable):**  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys for the LLM and vector database services.

## Usage

1.  **Prepare your documents:** Place your PDF or text files in a designated folder within the project (e.g., `data/`).
2.  **Process documents and create embeddings:** Run the script responsible for loading, chunking, and embedding your documents into the vector database. (You'll need to develop this script as part of your project).
3.  **Start the RAG-powered chat interface:** (You'll need to develop this script, which will likely involve a user interface like Streamlit or a command-line interface as shown in the example below).

    For example, for a basic command-line interface:

    ```bash
    python main.py  # Assuming your main application file is main.py
    ```
4.  **Ask questions:** Type your questions about the documents into the chat interface.
5.  **Get answers:** The AI Assistant will provide relevant answers based on the information retrieved from your documents and the LLM's capabilities.
